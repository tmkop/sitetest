            This is a collection of programs I have made to document my
            journey coding and to provide small interactive experiences that
            may educate or entertain. My passion of coding first started in
            2020 when I took an AP Computer Science class and learned the basics
            of Javascript. This new power to simply make the computer do it
            pushed me to continue learning and creating programs that I ran
            on my computer. October 2021 it occurred to me that for very
            little I could buy a domain and host it to share my programs
            with others. I hope you enjoy what you find and have a good day.
